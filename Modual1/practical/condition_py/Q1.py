#Practical Example 5: Write a Python program to find greater and less than a number using if_else.


a = 100
b = 100
c = 50

if a>b:
    if a>c:
        print("A is greater")
    else:
        print("C is greater")
else:
    if b>c:
        print("B is greater")
    else:
        print("C is greater")
